# Spring-Boot-Projects
Java Spring Boot Projects to help me get on with my internship and grasp into the essentials of microservices.

In the course and specifically this project I've touched on so far the following principles:
    
    - REST API and HTTP Methods - in collaboration with Postman
    - RESTController, GetMapping, PathVariable, RequestParam
    - ResponseEntity for HTTP status codes and Optional Variables
    - Calling objects into the controller and playing with the output
    - Component, Autowired, Service
    - RequestHeader, RequestBody, PostMapping, PutMapping, DeleteMapping
